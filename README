Important:
--You must use the special large-string build of NSIS to avoid wiping out users' path, see http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Environmental_Variables:_append,_prepend,_and_remove_entries

Pre-build:
* Add tested 32-bit versions of node.exe and mongod.exe to `deployd\tools`
* Add tested version of npm, shelljs, and commander to `deployd\node_modules`
* Delete `deployd\node_modules\deployd`
* `cd` into `dpd-win-installer\deployd\`
* Run `tools\node.exe node_modules\npm\cli.js install deployd`

Build installer:
* `cd` into `dpd-win-installer\`
* Update this line in `setup.nsi` to match the current version of Deployd:  `!define VERSION x.x.x`
* Run `makensis setup.nsi`
* Your new installer will be at `dpd-win-installer\build
